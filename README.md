# RAINFALL
#ML
#SVM
As global warming increases detection and
prediction of rainfall is becoming a major problem in
countries which do not have access to proper
technology and which if done accurately can help them
for several purposes such as farming, health, drinking
and many other. And for this purpose we predict the
rainfall of coming year using SVR, SVM and KNN
machine learning algorithm and compare the results
inferred by each algorithm
